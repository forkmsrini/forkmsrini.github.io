MLLabs is an Deep Learning for enterprises company that is leveraging the power of AI to bridge the gap between perception and context while enabling easy-to-use applications. TheThingsCloud is an CleanTech-IoT pivoted start-up with a mixed flavor of advanced hardware design and artificial intelligence to build smart device's ecosystems. The fundamental principle, is that, we exploit the interplay of physical sciences and analytics.

Understand the mechanism by which the brain translates environmental signals into intelligent behavior. I'm inquisitive about the working of our brain, its cognitive architecture and would like to build applications using artificial intelligence that mimic the nous. I'm particularly interested in **Machine Learning** and its applications. Theoretical aspects of Statistics like probability modeling and large scale statistical estimation problems intrigue me.

I’m an ardent classical music (the Indian flavor) listener. <br/> I’m actively learning some parts of Yajurveda (यजुर्वेदः). <br/>I enjoying volunteering at the IEEE (Bangalore) section and I'm an organizer of the Deep Learning Bangalore Meetup.

<li>How do we teach ourself about the interactive world?</li>
<li>How are objects, actions, languages and vision integrated? Can we replicate this do achieve assistive machine intelligence?</li>
<li>Where and how does data play a role in these processes?</li>
</ul>

I'm not particularly excited by the empirical success of deep learning and would like to scientifically investigate if we require large number of representations and filters.
