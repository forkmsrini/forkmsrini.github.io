MLLabs is an Insights-As-A-Service company that also develop interactive dashboards and APIs for data visualization. TheThingsCloud is an IoT-Big Data pivoted start-up with a mixed flavor of advanced hardware design and artificial intelligence to build smart devices’ ecosystems. At both the companies, we exploit the interplay of physical sciences and analytics.

Understand the mechanism by which the brain translates environmental signals into intelligent behavior. I'm inquisitive about the working of our brain, its cognitive architecture and would like to build applications using artificial intelligence that mimic the nous. I'm particularly interested in **Machine Learning** and its applications. Theoretical aspects of Statistics like probability modeling and large scale statistical estimation problems intrigue me.

I’m an ardent classical music (the Indian flavor) listener. Maharajapuram Santhanam is to me the bes artist. <br/> I’m actively learning some parts of Yajurveda (यजुर्वेदः). <br/>I enjoying volunteering at the IEEE (Bangalore) section and IISc-SIAM chapter.

<li>How do we teach ourself about the interactive world?</li>
<li>How are objects, actions, languages and vision integrated? Can we replicate this do achieve assistive machine intelligence?</li>
<li>Where and how does data play a role in these processes?</li>
</ul>

I'm not particularly excited by the empirical success of deep learning and would like to scientifically investigate if we require large number of representations and filters.
